# Airline Search Engine

## Description: 
- The goal of the project is a search engine for airlines, which may have a simple user interface prompting users for a variety of inputs or constraints to search airline trips.
  The application would be built with Python, FlaskAPI as backend and React as front end with the dataset querying using Neo4J database. 
- The engine would be able to efficiently find airports with different conditions such as operating with a specified country.
  Additionally, airlines can also be searched based on some stopsâ€™ constraints.
  Moreover, the application would also provide users with trip recommendations from their desired stops.
  Besides building this application, we are also interested in parallel algorithms on graph data structure.
  They are complicated algorithms, but efficient and able to solve complex problems.
  Therefore, our goal is also to explore these powerful methods.
